Semantic Analyis is a Java GUI Application to analyse and compare large amounts of text on a semantic level. It includes a reader for comparing text snippets with the semantic search phrase, a word highlighting feature and analyzer/stemmer from lucene. It contains code from the semantic vectors project. Thanks for the work, Dominic Widdows and Team:
